FileTypeIdentifier: A machin learning algorithem used to automatically identify which type of programming language the file written by.

Requirement
===========

Python module: theano, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn    

    (sudo) pip install theano numpy scipy scikit-learn

=====

Now, you can run the script by following command:    

    python main.py

or

    python code_identifier.py    

and follow the help message(The usage part.).    
code_identifier.py is implemented with Theano, while main.py is implemented with Scikit-Learn.

PS: The usage of this tool is still a little bit trick, and it should be more user-friendly in the near feature.
